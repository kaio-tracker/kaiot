# KAIOT

Welcome to the **KAIOT** project repository.

This will be the future home of the source code for **KAIOT** — an open-source task tracker designed to be self-hosted 
on your personal server.

Development has just started, so for now, things are mostly empty — stay tuned!

## Why "KAIOT"?

The name **KAIOT** is derived from **"kaio tracker"**, where *kaio* (カイコ) means *silkworm* in Japanese — a creature 
that builds its cocoon thread by thread with quiet persistence.

In ancient Japan and China, silk weaving was an art — a careful, gradual process that transformed the tiniest threads 
into intricate and beautiful fabrics.

**KAIOT** is built on the same principle: tasks completed step by step, with purpose and focus, to weave something 
meaningful over time.
